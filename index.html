        Vericite is a producer of fobs. A Fob is an object that can take the form of a small electrical device, a piece
        of jewelry, or a counterweight to watches. As jewelry, the qualities of the fob itself are enjoyed like a piece
        of art. Vericite makes fobs that are like jewelry or art. They have no real function other than to be enjoyed
        for their intrinsic qualities. Vericite fobs are also Non-Fungible Tokens. The quality of the NFT ensures the
        authenticity of the fob. Ideally, the authenticity of the object should not be affected by copies. A copy of the
        art does not negatively affect the value of the original art. The opposite is true, the duplication of the art
        creates a type of 'currency' or current usage, that gives the original object value.
