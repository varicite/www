## About Varicite

Vericite is a producer of fobs. A Fob is an object that can take the form of a small electrical device, a piece of jewelry, or a counterweight to watches. As jewelry, the qualities of the fob itself are enjoyed like a piece of art. Vericite makes fobs that are like jewelry or art. They have no real function other than to be enjoyed for their intrinsic qualities. Vericite fobs are also Non-Fungible Tokens. The quality of the NFT ensures the authenticity of the fob. Ideally, the authenticity of the object should not be affected by copies. A copy of the art does not negatively affect the value of the original art. The opposite is true, the duplication of the art creates a type of 'currency' or current usage, that gives the original object value.

## About Varicite Fobs

A Varicite fob is meant to be a piece of art or jewelry.
The fob is a size that can be held in a human's hand.
Non-Fungible Tokens are used to establish the fob's unique identity.

Varicite creates fobs in series. A series shares a common design generated from a script. Within each series, there are variations that ensure that each design is unique.

The design of the fob is generated programmatically.
The data and the script that is used to describe the design are saved and associated with the NFT. This data then can be used to duplicate the design.

## Creating the design

Computer code is written to generate a design that is used to make the fob.  The first step is the generation of a data file. This file holds the data that describes the design. Once the design is described it is used to generate an SVG file. It is the SVG file that can be sent to a laser printer for the creation of the fob.

### The NFT

The quality of uniqueness is defined primarily by the technologies, blockchain, NFT (Non-Fungible Token), and the IPFS (IPFS Interplanetary File System).

### Series of fobs. 

A set of fobs is generated from the same script. Within the script, there are any number of variables that are changed so that each design is unique. A series of designs may take the theme of a spiral, circles, or squares.

### The transfer of the design to acrylic.

The data that is generated from the script is used to create an SVG file. This SVG file is sent to a laser cutter to be cut in acrylic.

## The duplication of the fob and its design is considered good

Traditionally, the duplication of a distinct piece of art without some kind of compensation to the originator of the art was considered a form of theft.

With the establishment of the fob as a verifiable authentic unique object, the creation of a fake version is almost impossible. The duplication of the design contributes to the design being known. The design is current in the sense that it is something in current use, someone finds value in the design and uses it. It is this currency of the design that increases the value of the unique object.

The reproduction of the design of the unique fob is in the interest of the owner.

The code for the design is published and accessible, and its' usage is encouraged. The more the specific design is reproduced the more the specific fob becomes known to the general public. It is this notoriety that should result in the value of the fob increasing. 

Vericite intends that the reproduction of the design of the fob will increase the value of the unique object that is the fob.

## Development

The first phase of development will be a prototype of two fobs.
The second phase will be a product that implements all the concepts presented here.

### The prototype

The prototype will consist of two fobs created from Python scripts.
Information about how the fob was produced along with the actual code will be published to IPFS.
The fob will be recorded in a blockchain as an NFT. 

### The product

A series of ten fobs will be created. The design will be of the theme, spirals. The output of running the code will be used to cut acrylic plastic fobs.

### The Spiral

A spiral is drawn with dots. These dots vary in size. They can grow from small to large or from small to large or be random in size. 


## Technical Stack

### Front End

Gatsby, JavaScript, React, CSS, HTML, 

A standard strategy toward the front end is ideal. The following technologies are standard solutions to achieve a basic shopping site like the Varicite site.

### Backend Blockchain
Solidity, Hedera
Linux, Git code repo, hosting

A Solidity contract is used for the actions of minting and transferring the NFT Fobs.
The Hedera network is used to record blockchain records. 

Currently, 10 NFT fobs are established in a test network.

In the website listing of the fob, there are displayed links to the Hedera network. 

In the listing, there are also links to Git repositories that hold the code that can be used to reproduce the design.

### Creation of Physical Object

The Fob is a piece of acrylic plastic into which the design has been engraved. The engraving is done with the SVG file that is generated from the script and laser cutters.
