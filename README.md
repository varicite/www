## About Vericite

Vericite is a producer of fobs.
A fob is an object that can be used as a piece of jewelry or as a counterweight to watches. The qualities of the fob itself can be enjoyed like a piece of art.

## About Vericite Fobs

The fob is cut with a laser cutter from plastic.
The design of the fob is generated programmatically.
Non-Fungible Tokens are used to establish the fob's unique identity.
A series of fobs are created. A series shares a common design generated from a common script.

Within the series, there are variations as a result of the variable in the script.
The process of creation ensures that each design is unique and can be reproduced exactly.
The data that is used to describe the design is saved and associated with the NFT.
This data is then used to create an SVG file that will be used for the cutting of the plastic.

## The duplication of the fob and its design is considered good.

Traditionally, the duplication of a distinct piece of art without some kind of compensation to the originator of the art was considered a form of theft.

With the establishment of the fob as a verifiable authentic unique object, the creation of a fake version is almost impossible. The duplication of the design establishes the design as something current. 
Current in the sense that it is something in use as of now. Someone finds value in the design and uses it.
It is this currency of the design that increases the value of the unique object

The reproduction of the design of the unique fob is in the interest of the owner.

The code for the design is published and its' reproduction is encouraged. The more the specific design is reproduced the more the specific fob becomes known to the general public. It is this notoriety that should result in the value of the fob increasing. Vericite intends that the reproduction of the design of the fob will increase the value of the unique object that is the fob.

## The NFT

The qualities of uniqueness are defined primarily by NFT (Non-Fungible Token) and the IPFS (IPFS Interplanetary File System).

## Future Development

The first phase of development will be a prototype of two fobs.
The second phase will be a product that implements all the concepts presented here.

### The prototype

The prototype will consist of two fobs created from Python scripts.
Information about how the fob was produced along with the actual code will be published to IPFS.
The fob will be recorded in a blockchain as an NFT. 

### The product

A series of twenty fobs, The design will be of the theme, spirals. 
The output of running the code will be used to cut clear acrylic plastic fobs.

## The code used to generate the design

Python is used to generate the designs used to cut the fobs. 
The library Shapely is used. Shapely is a graphics library for Geo-spatial visualization but its shape-generating ability can be applied in many ways. 
The first step is the generation of a data file. This file holds the data that describes the design.
Once the design is described it is used to generate an SVG file. It is the SVG file that is sent to a laser printer for the creation of the fob.

Sets of fobs. A set of fobs is generated from the same script. Within the script, there are any number of variables that are changed so that each design is unique.

The Spiral

A spiral is drawn with dots. These dots vary in size. They can grow from small to large or from small to large or be random in size. The various spiral vary in how the radius of the spiral increases.

## The transfer of the design to Acrylic.
The data the is generated from the script is then used to create an SVG file that is sent to a laser cutter. The design is cut to a piece of acrylic 6mm thick.
